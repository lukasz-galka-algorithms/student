class Graph:
    """
    A tiny, DIRECTED graph backed by an adjacency list.
    Edge weights (costs) default to 1.

    What it models
    --------------
    - Nodes can be *any hashable* objects (e.g., str, int, tuples like (r, c)).
    - Edges are *directed* with an optional non-negative weight (cost).
      For an undirected graph, add both directions explicitly.

    Design notes
    ------------
    - Internally we keep:  _adj: dict[node] -> list[(neighbor, cost)]
      This is compact, fast to update, and easy to traverse.
    - We do not de-duplicate edges; adding the same (u, v, cost) twice
      will produce two parallel entries. (Thatâ€™s fine for most search labs.)

    Doctest-style examples
    ----------------------
    >>> g = Graph()
    >>> g.add_edge('A', 'B')         # cost defaults to 1
    >>> g.add_edge('B', 'C', 3)      # weighted edge
    >>> g.neighbors('B')
    [('C', 3)]
    >>> sorted(g.nodes())
    ['A', 'B', 'C']
    >>> sorted(g.edges())
    [('A', 'B', 1), ('B', 'C', 3)]

    Undirected usage (by adding both directions):
    >>> g2 = Graph()
    >>> g2.add_edge('X', 'Y', 5)
    >>> g2.add_edge('Y', 'X', 5)
    >>> set(g2.neighbors('X')) == {('Y', 5)}
    True

        Parameters
        ----------
        u : hashable
            Node identifier (e.g., str, int, tuple).

        Behavior
        --------
        - If `u` is not present, creates an empty neighbor list for it.
        - If `u` already exists, this is a no-op.

        Add a *directed* edge u -> v with a given `cost`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        u, v : hashable
            Endpoints of the edge (nodes). Created on the fly if missing.
        cost : number (default: 1)
            Edge weight (travel cost). For undirected graphs, call twice:
            add_edge(u, v, cost) and add_edge(v, u, cost).

        Notes
        -----
        - Edges are not deduplicated; you can have parallel edges.
        - The class does not validate cost sign.
