class Search:
    """
    Canonical shortest-path search routines on graphs with non-negative edge weights.

    What it provides
    ----------------
    - Dijkstra (Uniform-Cost Search) for optimal paths on non-negative weights.
    - A* Search with a user-supplied heuristic `h(n)`; if `h=None`, behaves like Dijkstra.

    Return format
    -------------
    Both algorithms return a dict:
      {
        'path':   [start, ..., goal]      # empty list if unreachable
        'cost':   total_path_cost         # float('inf') if unreachable
        'visited': [n1, n2, ...]          # order in which nodes were expanded
      }
